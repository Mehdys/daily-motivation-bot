# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Quick Guide

Your commits are ready with backdated history (from June 2025)! 

## Steps to Push:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `daily-motivation-bot` (or `Daily-Motivation-Bot`)
3. Description: "Daily Motivation Bot - Sends AI-generated motivational quotes via email"
4. Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Push Your Code

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/mehdigribaa/Desktop/WhsMsg

# Add your GitHub repo as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/daily-motivation-bot.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
